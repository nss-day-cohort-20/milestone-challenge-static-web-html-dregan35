                <p>Hello, my name is David Regan. I am a thirty-five-year-old male with twin six-year-old daughters and have been married to my lovely wife Jennifer for twelve wonderful years. I started my journey in the tech world when I was fifteen building computers, soldiering modchips into Xbox's or Playstation’s, and sound engineering for churches (which consisted of running 30-100 channel soundboards for various gospel groups). I now find myself in uncharted territory because I have spent my life taking care of others. First furthering my wife’s career making sure she obtained her Ba degree, counseling church members to help them fulfil their dreams then taking care of my children (something I have done since birth). Suddenly everyone says it's my turn to work on me and make my goals come true. Honestly I'm having some trouble with this after devoting so much of my time to others I feel a little selfish, but I know that it is time to make something of my dreams or die trying!</p>
